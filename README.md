# Design challenge for OpenRent role
I chose this page: ``` https://www.openrent.co.uk/landlord-electrical-safety-certificates-eicr-pat-testing ```

Since the challenge asked not to spend too much time (and I honestly don't have much of it ðŸ™‚) I just did the top part where I would have slightly changed some elements. The rest of the page can remain almost the same. I will just make the "customer testimonies" like a deck of cards (as if there are more underneath)

## How to run please
- clone / download
- Navigate into the folder
- run ``` npm run dev ```
- [Ctrl + Click[ (on Windows) or [Command + Click] (on Mac) on the localhost link that vite will show in the terminal


### Let me know
Doesn't run?
